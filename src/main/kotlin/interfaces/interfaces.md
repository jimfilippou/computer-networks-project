# Package interfaces

### Introduction
Interfaces are 100% useless in a project like this, however I like 
to keep things clean and implement the Factory design pattern
as it was tought by AUEB's Prof Diamantidis in Software Engineering course.
This module is 100% dedicated to the implementation of the factory.
